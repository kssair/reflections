Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:When there is need for colaboration or I would like to work from different PCs and have possibility to access it from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Don't know yet.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks if you don't want to change original repo.
Clone when you want to have repo of someone else at your place and make changes to it.
Branches - for a different version of a code or sth.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
hmm, we can check and compare the to the remote?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be much harder without.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When trying new feature of a code, and not sure if we want to change master branch with that feature?
