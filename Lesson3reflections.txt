Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:When there is need for colaboration or I would like to work from different PCs and have possibility to access it from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
