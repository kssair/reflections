What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-> It creates a .git folder which is for tracking history of repo, show me that there are some untracked files, and no commits yet

->staging area differ from working directory and  the repository that it atcs as a link between them, you can put files to the staging area in different time and then commit them at onces

Staging area could be use at different files at different times and later you can commit them all at once.

Branches are very useful for situation when you want try some new feature, new version of a code but don't want to change master version. 

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
One branch which commits on the one that is checked out while merging. 

Somehow it didn't show exact output as in the course, maybe different version of GIT?

Automatic merging is good when there are no conflicts
